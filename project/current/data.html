<p>Business consulting, data-driven strategy, and digital transformation support is among services provided by the Company. Service delivery depends on real-time access to shared documents and apps.</p>
<p>The Company operates with Data of different levels of security. The Company use different policies and procedures for data transfer and storage. Policies can vary client by client.Company operations are data-driven, compliance with major data privacy frameworks is a selling point for clients. Client trust is company's currency. The ability to demonstrate compliance—through logs, access control, and policies—must be always available.</p>
<p>Data Classification</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-house Data:</strong> Documentation, knowledge-based, client-specific, and delivered digitally—reports, strategies, analytics, and process improvement plans, internal communication. Specific  data for departnents like: Finance, HR, Customer Support, Compliance, IT, Cybersecurity.</li>
<li><strong>Sensitive Data:</strong> Trade secrets, contracts, finantial Data, personal HIPAA-like Data.</li>
<li><strong>Publicly available data:</strong> Industry insights, market trend summaries, and non-confidential performance benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff often deal with confidential client data regularly—keeping that protected is vital. Loss or theft of the Data could cause competitive disadvantage. Moreover, fines from non-compliance could be a major unplanned expense.</p>
<p>Daily operations involve teams working across projects—internal collaboration tools, project management software, time tracking, and secure file exchange are essential. Cross-department access should be limited—especially between finance, HR, and client-facing teams.
Usability and clarity matter—staff shouldn’t circumvent security because it’s confusing or overly strict.</p>
<p>If we allow external users—vendors, contractors, etc.—they must be restricted to the minimum access required for their task. Their access shouldn't interfere with internal systems or logs. Keep their traffic logically segmented.</p>
<p>Secure by default, but not at the expense of user experience.
Usability matters, but compliance comes first. If there’s tension between convenience and security, security wins—but design it smartly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a practide in the company when New teams often start informally with  ad hoc access or “shadow IT”, it need to be addressed before it becomes a compliance risk.</p>

<li>Role-based access control.</li>
<li>Controlled sharing to prevent leaks. Comply with principle of minimum access. Minimal data retention.</li>
<li>Proper network segmentation to ensure staff only access what they need.</li>
<li>Internal collaboration tools and  operational tools must meet the same standards as customer-facing systems.</li>
<li>Access logging, and regular reviews.</li>

<h2 id="data-loss-prevention"><a class="header" href="#data-loss-prevention">Data Loss Prevention</a></h2>
<p>Backup systems should automatically take over to prevent data gaps.
Data protection is very important at the end the company daily operations are data-driven. No partial data loss; restore to last known consistent state. Maintain data retention and deletion practices per regulations to avoid penalties. Missing even a few minutes of compliance data can result in regulatory violations. Missing compliance data due to downtime can trigger penalties or legal exposure.</p>
<p>To prevent Data Loss the data processing systems must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale to handle surge in file transfers and communications.</li>
<li>Downtime should not expose data or cause loss of in-progress work.</li>
<li>Operational data should not be lost during interruptions.</li>
<li>Need redundancy so anything that can negatively impact data processing process  don’t stall day-to-day company's activity.</li>
<li>Company must meet legal and contractual obligations around data storage, access, and reporting—especially if clients are in regulated industries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encrypted storage, access logging, and data protection—but we don’t need bleeding-edge tech.<br />
Encryption, immutability, and geographically diverse backups.<br />
Compliance audit logs, access control records, and incident reports — stored in secured, tamper-evident   systems and must recover within 5 minutes to maintain continuous evidence chains.<br />
Compliance audit logs, access control records, and incident reports — stored in secured, tamper-evident systems. Must be maintained in real time with redundant backups.</p>

Reliable access logs and audit tools must function at all times—interrupted logging is a red flag. Video or access log loss during an incident could jeopardize an investigation or audit.</p>

<h2 id="ai"><a class="header" href="#ai">AI</a></h2>
<p>AI is relatively new thing and it often presents new attack vectors. I decided to give it a separate section.</p>
<p>Company exploring AI-driven customer tools, which will likely require cloud compute access, fast data exchange, and potentially more traffic between teams. Also, new product lines may add collaboration platforms or partner integrations. AI initiatives raise new privacy and security risks, especially if we use internal data for training. AI or data analytics tools can  increase compute and storage demands.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't assume every remote worker is tech-savvy. Simplicity, clarity, and minimal barriers will reduce support tickets.</li>
<li>It is preferred that remote employee log in once, and they're good to go.</li>
<li>Tools should work just as well from home, the airport, or a co-working space.</li>
<li>Performance between offices matters—especially for file transfers, video calls, and real-time collaboration tools. Must be accessible to distributed teams without bottlenecks.</li>
<li>VPNs or secure tunnels should not slow things down to the point people try to bypass them.</li>
<li>Clear, consistent experience between in-office and remote logins reduces confusion and training burden.</li>
<li>Any access from outside the Company must comply with our regulatory environment. External access is a high-risk vector if mismanaged.</li>
<li>External stuff often need limited access—to shared drives, project tools, or documentation. Segmented, task-specific access is essential. But maintain 'zero trust' - verify everything, restrict everything. No backdoors.</li>
<li>Remote access must meet the same compliance standards as in-office—no shortcuts. Encryption, role-based access, and secure data transfer must be built in. All industry-specific standards apply.</li>
<li>Logging and auditing must still apply to remote sessions.</li>
<li>Enforce data encryption, device security posture checks, and possibly geo-blocking/logging. Sensitive info must never transit insecurely.</li>

<p>Here are several sections per department, explaining which department  process highly sensitive Data.</p>
<h3 id="finantial-department"><a class="header" href="#finantial-department">Finantial Department</a></h3>
<p>Company manages client invoices, financial data, and partner contracts .All of this  require secure, traceable systems. Financial transactions must be protected from corruption if downtime occurs mid-process. Secure high-volume data transfers to banks and payment processors are essential. Accounting platforms must handle larger data loads without lag.</p>
<p>Breaches in payment systems could have immediate financial and legal consequences.
Financial records, banking details, and payment card data — kept in accounting systems and secure payment processors. Finantial operations must maintain PCI-DSS compliance for any payment data, even temporary setups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite high risks financial staff often work from home.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="customer-support-clients-contractors"><a class="header" href="#customer-support-clients-contractors">Customer Support, Clients, Contractors</a></h3>
<p>Company handles highly confidential, client-specific reports, analytics, and strategic recommendations. This data is proprietary to each client and must be kept strictly segregated—accessible only to authorized staff working on that account.</p>
<p>Critical, client-facing apps (CRM, proposal tools, video conferencing).</p>
<p>Operational blueprints, supplier contracts, and project schedules — stored on internal servers and cloud collaboration platforms.<br />
Client contracts, proposals, and strategic plans — usually stored in our document management system and shared via secure portals.</p>
<h3 id="hr-department"><a class="header" href="#hr-department">HR Department</a></h3>
<p>Employee data is highly sensitive. There is a risk of  exposure or loss of personal information. Employee personal data (SSNs, addresses, health benefit info) stored in Applicant tracking and HRIS and payroll systems.
Restoring incorrect HR data could cause payroll or benefits errors.</p>
<p>Privacy tools, access controls, and audit trails are non-negotiable.
Meanwhile HR systems must allow fast access for legitimate needs while keeping data private.
Secure but rapid access for the HR team, especially during payroll cycles is essential - downtime affects payroll or benefits processing, employee dissatisfaction rises quickly.</p>
<h3 id="board-of-executives"><a class="header" href="#board-of-executives">Board of Executives</a></h3>
<p>Different level of reporting or dashboards are required to keep hihtly ranked company's executives informed. This reports must be, automated with  push-based updates. Protected from unautorized access.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CEO:</strong>
Give me a top-level health score—green/yellow/red—and trend lines for business impact: downtime, employee complaints, growth readiness.
Monthly or quarterly snapshots are enough unless there’s a major issue.
Brief summaries of incidents or close calls—risk awareness without deep detail.
Don’t bury me in metrics—tell me what’s going well, what’s not, and where we’re vulnerable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CFO:</strong>
I want to see cost and efficiency metrics: license usage, cloud bandwidth, hardware utilization—anything that reflects value for spend.
Quarterly summary is sufficient unless a cost spike occurs.
Unusual usage or security incidents that could lead to financial loss should be flagged immediately.
Bonus points for reports that show forecast vs. actual on tech spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COO:</strong>
I need a simple, visual dashboard showing key operational indicators: uptime, latency, ticket volumes, and user login success rates. Daily or weekly rollups are fine—no need for overload.
Alerts for service degradation or unusual traffic patterns would help us catch problems before they escalate.
Ideally, some visibility into patch status or device health across endpoints.
Don’t make us chase down reports—automated, push-based updates are ideal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance Officer:</strong>
I need access to detailed logs and historical reports—user access logs, system changes, data transfers—for audits and investigations.
Monthly compliance reports, alert thresholds, and data export capabilities are must-haves.
Support retention policies, role-based report access, and audit trails that show who accessed what and when.
Reporting must be tamper-proof and reviewable by auditors—accuracy and integrity are non-negotiable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HR Director:</strong>
I’d like visibility into user lifecycle metrics—onboarding times, account provisioning speed, access compliance.
Track how long it takes for new users to get fully set up. Spot delays or policy violations.
Confirm offboarding events (logins revoked, data locked down) are properly executed.
I don’t need full dashboards—just HR-relevant extracts shared periodically.</p>
