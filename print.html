<p>This document outlines a project to assess, design, and propose a sustainable cybersecurity framework for the Company. As the assigned Cybersecurity Engineer, this initiative was informed by a simulated interview process with key company executives, including the CEO, CFO, COO, HR Director, and Compliance Officer. The insights gathered from their perspectives serve as the foundational business and technical requirements for this project.</p>
<p>Given that a baseline security posture assessment was not part of the initial executive inquiry, this project will assume the necessity of foundational security practices, including a comprehensive internal audit, inventory updates, and a review of existing policies and playbooks.</p>
<p>The core of this assignment is a multi-phased approach that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document and contextualize the executives’ requirements to inform strategic security recommendations.</li>
<li>Simulate the company's network and key host environments.</li>
<li>Implement layered network protection and security controls.</li>
<li>Run simulated network activity to establish a performance baseline.</li>
<li>Conduct targeted attacks against the simulated environment to test the efficacy of the implemented defenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognizing the technical constraints of executing all simulations on a single machine, the network will be logically segmented into distinct zones. This approach will allow for focused testing of several key scenarios, providing a comprehensive yet resource-efficient analysis of the company’s security posture. The conclusions from this analysis, compiled in the 'Initial State' section, will inform all subsequent recommendations and plans.</p>

<p>The company is middle size consulting company. Specializing in providing international business consulting, <strong>data-driven</strong> strategy, and digital transformation support to mid-size and enterprise clients. Company have publicly available as well as highly secure data. Data privacy vary depending on the client's needs.</p>
<p>Companie's Operations are subject to heavy regulations. GDPR<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, HIPAA<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, ISO 27001<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>, PCI-DSS<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>.
The Company is subject to industry audit and certifications. The Company is envolved in Finantial Operaions. Company must be able to perform secure high-volume data transfers to banks and payment processors. Company store and process highly sensitive Data.</p>
<p>The companie's highly ranked executives have quite high Risk Appetite. But ask for high level of security operations. Companie's CEO and CFO have approved that if it is practical and required they are ready to invest in security operations. Company executive board value customer trust and security and stress the Importance of InfoSec at all stages of Daily Activities. The Company positioning yourselve as a forward-thinking, responsible brand.</p>
<p>ROI<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-5-1"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> means different things to different executives for some lowerst operation cost is important for others begger rewenue even with some risk is acceptable. Things as passing audits faster and cleaner, network withour bottleneck, and quicker onboarding of new employees are also were among the requirements.</p>
<p>The Company is exploring AI-driven customer tools, which will likely require cloud compute access, fast data exchange, and potentially more traffic between teams. But executive do stress that with open minded approach to AI and more 'innovative' solutions high risk appetite and tolerance could lead to finantial and reputation loses.</p>
<h2 id="current-department-sizes"><a class="header" href="#current-department-sizes">Current Department Sizes</a></h2>
<p>At the moment Company orperates with prohimately 100 employees plus 10–15 regular contractors. Guests vary — maybe 3–5 visiting clients or partners per day. Currently the Company has  total of 8 departments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Services / Consulting – ~35 people (core delivery team)</li>
<li>Sales &amp; Marketing – ~15 people</li>
<li>Finance &amp; Accounting – ~8 people</li>
<li>Human Resources – ~6 people</li>
<li>IT &amp; Systems Support – ~10 people</li>
<li>Operations / Admin – ~12 people</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="plans-to-grow-and-expand"><a class="header" href="#plans-to-grow-and-expand">Plans to grow and expand</a></h2>
<p>The setup works for now, but the Company is  planning to expand within the next 12–18 months.
Company exploring AI-driven customer tools, which will likely require cloud compute access, fast data exchange, and potentially more traffic between teams. Also, new product lines may add collaboration platforms or partner integrations. R&amp;D<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-6-1"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> or Data Analytics are also part of the plan.
Company actively exploring adding a Business Intelligence or Innovation function to stay ahead in our field. That may mean hiring analysts, data scientists, or even developers.</p>
<p>Companie's executives  considering regional offices or satellite hubs to support growth and access new talent markets. This might mean splitting into two or three locations within the next 2–3 years. Remote hiring is also driving this decision. Each location must operate autonomously, but stay connected to HQ for collaboration and data access.</p>
<p>These new sites would likely serve client delivery, sales, or regional support roles. They’ll need access to central systems (CRM<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-7-1"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup>, project management, shared drives) and reliable uptime. Any expansion into new regions must account for local data laws—especially if crossing international boundaries. Performance between offices matters—especially for file transfers, video calls, and real-time collaboration tools. Each location needs central policy control with localized enforcement—e.g., firewall rules, user access, device management.</p>
<h3 id="plans-to-grow-for-foreseeable-future"><a class="header" href="#plans-to-grow-for-foreseeable-future">Plans to grow for foreseeable future</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Geographic expansion possible satellite offices with strong separation.</li>
<li>More remote hires (expected almost double in size), more BYOD. Requiring stronger IT and HR presence.</li>
<li>Diversification into data analytics and digital transformation services.</li>
<li>Increasing compliance demands from larger and more regulated clients.</li>
<li>Increase usage of modern solutinos such as AI in day-to-day activities.</li>
<li>Considering creating new teams in Data Analytics and Product Development as well as Business Intelligence or Innovation and  R&amp;D<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-6-2"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>.</li>
<li>There is a possibility of HQ relocation. Legal complience, need in more space, security can drive stakeholders to this decision, but relocation is a last resort—we’d rather grow in place if possible.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Client Services / Consulting: +30–40% growth (driven by new contracts and expansion into new regions). Expect to reach ~45–50 staff.</li>
<li>Sales &amp; Marketing: +25–30% growth to expand market share—likely 18–20 staff.</li>
<li>Finance &amp; Accounting: Minimal growth (~10–15%) as automation offsets headcount increases—9–10 staff.</li>
<li>Human Resources: +30–40% to handle hiring surge—likely 8–9 staff.</li>
<li>IT &amp; Systems Support: +50% growth due to network expansion, multi-site support—up to 15 staff.</li>
<li>Operations / Admin: +20% to maintain service levels—~14–15 staff.</li>
<li>Compliance &amp; Risk: +40–50% due to more regulated clients—up to 7–8 staff.</li>
<li>Leadership / Executive: Small increase as structure flattens—likely 5–6 executives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expected-operation-cost"><a class="header" href="#expected-operation-cost">Expected operation cost</a></h2>
<p>For current operation (50–100 users), a realistic initial budget expected in the $50K–$150K range depending on complexity, with annual operating costs (licenses, monitoring, support) under $50K/year ideally.
Company is ready to invest in scalable, growth-ready infrastructure if abusiness case is justified.
Compnay iis expected to spend on high-impact areas—core connectivity, secure access, user support, but executuve board asked to avoid gold-plating. Executives are willing to pay now to avoid pain later and are fine to  invest in good security—when it's tie  back to reputation, uptime, or customer trust. It is better to avoid penny-wise, pound-foolish solutions, executives do nott want to revisit this in 12 months because we cut corners.</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems should require minimal babysitting by IT.</li>
<li>Don’t forget training and documentation costs.</li>
<li>Budget must include tools for onboarding/offboarding automation, identity management, and secure access.</li>
<li>Plan for IT support time, training, and communication—not just gear.</li>
<li>Budget must account for audit readiness, documentation, and secure data handling—not just networking gear.</li>

</ol><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-office"><a class="header" href="#the-office">The Office</a></h1>
<p>The Office is a mix of open workspaces, private offices, meeting rooms. At the moment Company rents ground and second floors of the building, roughly 557 square meters each. Staff are split between on-site and remote. Currently, about 60% of employees are on-site, 40% remote. This  expect to shift closer to 50/50 as more distributed talent hired.</p>
<p>About 70 staff in the office daily, 30 remote, 10–15 contractors split between on-site and remote. The building has been audited and certified within the last 12 months to accommodate highly data-sensitive operations. This includes compliance with relevant building security standards, controlled access, and infrastructure resilience requirements. Certificates are on file and available for inspection.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no dedicated generator for any of our suites.
UPS<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#footnote-2">1</a></sup> are installed for critical systems—including the server room, networking equipment, and key workstations in <strong>Finance, HR, and Compliance</strong>. They provide short-term power during outages to allow for safe shutdown or switchover. It is no clear what plans are for installing or leasing a power from generator which is on the site and used to support emergency systems.</p>
<p>Network cable capboards are somehow protected though it is not clear how and to what level of compliance. Physical cable routes should be secured, inspected regularly, and access-limited to authorized staff or contractors. It is not clear what level of audit was performed for a cable infrostructure and CFO has asked to cut down on the cost of rewiring, if possible, especially under the expectancy of office movement to different site.  Regular physical cable inspections are critical—tampering, wiretaps, or unauthorized rerouting must be detectable.</p>
<p>Dayly activities of office stuff include this services: email, file sharing, inventory management, CRM<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">2</a></sup> tools, and communication platforms like Slack or Teams.  For HR Department: HR systems (payroll, benefits, onboarding portals), video. For Secuirty:  Logging, and controls, compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories.</p>
<p>The server room is badge-access only, and our main entrance requires electronic access. Visitor sign-in is manual for now and  managed at reception. There is no clear separation of employees and departments. Some of the premises are protected and secure, but mostly the office is an open space.</p>
<p>Executives have agreed that: sensitive areas should be out of casual view, especially when clients tour the office. Modular and reconfigurable walls are ideal since we’re planning for future expansion or possible relocation. The board of executives urged to choose infrastructure that’s efficient, not overbuilt though - the Office may relocate within one year. Separation should not block Wi-Fi or disrupt network cabling—plan layout changes with IT in mind. Physical barriers reduce the risk of shoulder surfing, casual data exposure, and unauthorized listening in sensitive areas. For departments handling confidential data (Finance, HR, Compliance, Client Project Rooms), physical separation is not optional. Ensure secure storage for paper records within each department’s zone.

<li><strong>Publicly available data:</strong> Industry insights, market trend summaries, and non-confidential performance benchmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stuff often deal with confidential client data regularly—keeping that protected is vital. Loss or theft of the Data could cause competitive disadvantage. Moreover, fines from non-compliance could be a major unplanned expense.</p>
<p>Daily operations involve teams working across projects—internal collaboration tools, project management software, time tracking, and secure file exchange are essential. Cross-department access should be limited—especially between finance, HR, and client-facing teams.
Usability and clarity matter—staff shouldn’t circumvent security because it’s confusing or overly strict.</p>
<p>If we allow external users—vendors, contractors, etc.—they must be restricted to the minimum access required for their task. Their access shouldn't interfere with internal systems or logs. Keep their traffic logically segmented.</p>

<p>This document provides a summary of the current state of a company's network infrastructure, outlines the challenges, and presents a strategic roadmap for its future development. The recommendations are informed by the directives of the executive board to ensure the network becomes a scalable, secure, and strategic asset that supports our business growth.</p>
<h2 id="current-network-architecture"><a class="header" href="#current-network-architecture">Current Network Architecture</a></h2>
<p>Our current network setup is a blend of wired and wireless solutions designed to support on-site and remote work.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-site Connectivity:</strong> The office network provides stable LAN and Wi-Fi access for full-time employees, part-time staff, and contractors. However, network wiring is not universal across all areas, and retrofitting may be required to ensure seamless coverage. The network must maintain segregation between secure zones, even if we're spread across multiple floors or suites.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Access:</strong> Remote teams, including those in Financial, Sales, and IT, rely on a mix of cloud-based tools, VPNs, and video conferencing. A key challenge is maintaining consistent performance and security, as these users often connect from public or home networks with variable internet quality.</li>
<li><strong>Guest Access:</strong> Guests, including visitors and contractors, are granted internet-only access from designated areas like conference rooms and the lobby. This segregation helps to limit potential security risks.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Technology (OT) &amp; IoT:</strong> Smart boards, video conferencing systems, and digital signage are currently in use, but their segregation from sensitive business systems is a critical area for improvement to ensure both security and constant availability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-operational-and-security-challenges"><a class="header" href="#key-operational-and-security-challenges">Key Operational and Security Challenges</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Network Segregation:</strong> There is a need for clearer and more robust network segmentation. Critical systems, such as Accounting and ERP<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, must be resilient to network issues and isolated from less secure traffic. A secure, isolated environment is also needed for external users (e.g., vendors, contractors) and for new projects or acquisitions to mitigate risk.
The network must support secure inter-office communication (e.g., VPNs or SD-WAN), while still being flexible enough to adapt if we grow faster than expected.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability &amp; Performance:</strong> The current network infrastructure faces challenges in handling sudden spikes in traffic, which could be caused by new acquisitions, large file transfers, or the integration of new technologies like AI. Consistent performance during these bursts is not guaranteed.</li>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Compliance:</strong> We need to enhance our security posture to support audit readiness, maintain access logs, and enforce strict retention policies. The network must support granular access controls, especially for external users, to comply with regulatory requirements and minimize high-risk vectors.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience &amp; Redundancy:</strong> The network lacks comprehensive redundancy for internet and key services, making it vulnerable to single points of failure. Downtime could expose data or cause the loss of in-progress work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategic-directives-from-the-executive-board"><a class="header" href="#strategic-directives-from-the-executive-board">Strategic Directives from the Executive Board</a></h2>
<p>The executive board has outlined a clear vision for the network as a strategic asset. Our future network design must align with the following directives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable Growth:</strong> The network must be architected for future growth, including potential M&amp;A activities and rapid headcount increases. It should be modular and flexible, supporting expansion into new floors or buildings without requiring a complete redesign, it doesn't have to be department-specific to the point of rigidity. The focus should be on proactive, long-term investment to avoid future rework.
Network performance must stay consistent during traffic bursts—especially with AI pipelines or large file transfers.
Internal collaboration tools must scale to handle surge in file transfers and communications.
Assume variable internet quality. The solution should degrade gracefully and avoid requiring super-fast connections.
Plan for sudden load changes—a new acquisition could double our traffic overnight.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Resilience:</strong> The network must support graceful degradation and remain performant even with variable internet quality. It should be designed to handle sudden load changes and rapidly onboard new users, such as project-based contractors, without extensive manual configuration. Segregation of operational technology from the main network is a priority to prevent cross-impact.</li>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Compliance:</strong> Security must be foundational to the network's design. This includes robust access controls, secure external access, and a clear path to audit readiness. The network must be able to support granular access logs and retention policies to meet compliance requirements.
Remote users uch as financial, sales, IT often connect from public networks.</li>

Clear segmentation between employees, contractors, and guests to reduce risk.
Keep meeting room equipment  isolated from sensitive business systems.
Ensure no slowdown that might push staff to use unsanctioned tools.
No partial data loss; restore to last known consistent state.
Systems must support secure, compliant collaboration across borders.
Avoid any practice that could be seen as weakening client confidentiality.
We need systems that help us move fast and stay competitive. If security slows us down too much or frustrates staff, we lose productivity and possibly revenue.
Security should be “quiet” when it works—meaning fast logins, smooth access to systems, and minimal roadblocks to collaboration
We don’t want “perfect security” if it paralyzes us.

<p>Below is a list of threats / suggestions that I would purpose to executives in follow up meeting. Some I would investigate by myself some probably would stay in this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>After proper Inventory is ready. Protect and mitigate.</li>
<li>Create areas where all non-employees are allowed. Make sure that unauthorized person can access other areas in the Office.</li>
<li>Restrict physical access to secured areas, use tamper-evident measures to inspect unauthorized access to cables. Inspect this areas for unautorized access regularly.</li>
<li>InfoSec plans, tolerance, risk acceptance and complience</li>
<li>Need security team SOC.</li>
<li>Key and password escrow</li>
<li>Email services by third party organization.</li>
<li>Need more planning on BYOD, MDM, Cloud Services</li>
<li>Change Advisory Board (CAB) need proper assignment</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="change-floor-plan-for-counter-measures"><a class="header" href="#change-floor-plan-for-counter-measures">Change floor, plan for counter measures,</a></h2>
<p>There is a whole floor between our flors that mean that cables can be tampered there to install taps. It is hard to protect something that you do not controll. At the moment company do not controll the whole floor between our network.</p>
<p>In case if it is impossible (I presume it is) to change floors, use counter measures: Network Segmentation, VPN for Inter-Floor Connectivity, End-to-End Encryption (encryption for all company devices, including laptops and mobile phones), Employee Training, Visitor Management, Regular Audits, Multi-layer Security.</p>
<h2 id="cable-infrostructure"><a class="header" href="#cable-infrostructure">Cable Infrostructure</a></h2>
<p>This measure is practical for the area where company controll access and can use restrictive methods to prevent tampering.<br />
Inspecting physical cables for wiretaps and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks is a highly specialized area of security. It's often referred to as Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures (TSCM).
A proper physical inspection for taps and MITM attacks is not a DIY job. It requires a combination of strong physical security, a systematic visual inspection, and the use of professional, specialized tools like a TDR. For critical infrastructure, this is often performed by trained TSCM specialists who are experts in finding both passive and active surveillance devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there a certificates, cable maps?</li>
<li>All server rooms, wiring closets, and data centers should be locked and monitored.</li>
<li>Cable Management: All cables should be organized and secured, ideally in sealed conduits or raceways. Any loose, unorganized, or unlabeled cables should be investigated. Watch for access points in common areas.</li>
<li>Look for Tampering: Inspect all cables for any signs of tampering. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Strange splices or connectors: Look for unexpected splices, T-junctions, or any non-standard connectors. An unauthorized tap often involves a splice where the cable's jacket has been cut and wires have been attached.</li>
<li>Unusual devices: Look for small, unidentifiable devices attached to the cable or hidden nearby. Modern taps can be the size of a small USB stick or a cigarette pack.</li>
<li>Discrepancies in cable length: A physical tap may require a longer-than-expected cable run to connect to the attacker's device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-specialized-tools"><a class="header" href="#using-specialized-tools">Using Specialized Tools</a></h3>
<p>A simple visual inspection is often not enough, as many taps are designed to be covert. Proper inspection requires specialized equipment that can analyze the physical and electrical properties of the cable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to  detect physical taps.</li>
<li>Network Testers and Certifiers.</li>
<li>Cable Tracing and Mapping: Tools like tone generators and probes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="network-monitoring-and-analysis"><a class="header" href="#network-monitoring-and-analysis">Network Monitoring and Analysis</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Packet Analysis: Network monitoring tools like Wireshark.</li>
<li>Port Monitoring: On a managed switch, you can monitor the status of all ports. Manually shutdown all unused ports on network devices.</li>
<li>Map and monitor Wi-Fi access points. (perhaps need more on this)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wi-fi"><a class="header" href="#wi-fi">Wi-Fi</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Mapping of hot spots and their ACLs and autorization setups required.</li>

<h2 id="physical-department-separation"><a class="header" href="#physical-department-separation">Physical Department Separation</a></h2>
<p>Physical separation between departments would help protect sensitive work, improve focus and reduce the risk of shoulder surfing, casual data exposure, and unauthorized listening in sensitive areas. Even low-cost modular or false walls can create visual and acoustic barriers. This will be especially important for Finance, HR, Compliance, lient-specific project teams and cybersecurity team.<br />
Is is not clear if windows are dimmed so that it is impossible to spy on the company with optical equipement.<br />
There is video survelance in the office. What and who can see. It is an attack vector.<br />
Separation should not block Wi-Fi or disrupt network cabling—plan layout changes (keep infrostructure as much as possible).<br />
Plans shoud make sure pathways and line-of-sight to emergency exits remain clear for safety compliance.</p>
<h2 id="business-continuity-1"><a class="header" href="#business-continuity-1">Business Continuity</a></h2>
<p>There is high demand for high business continuity for all departments. During an interview with executives they all stressed upmost importance of almost 100% availability for customers and importance to comply with regulations in regard for logging and surveilance.</p>

<p>🔄 Next Questions to Think About
What VM tool do you use to wire networking? QEMU bridges + tap? virt-manager? custom script?
Do you want to simulate Internet access (with NAT)?
Do you want to test IDS/IPS tools (e.g., Suricata)?
Do you want VLANs to be real (802.1Q) or simulated (software separated)?
Will you monitor from the host (Wireshark, etc.)?</p>
<p>Excellent direction — you’re clearly aligning this with <strong>realistic enterprise-like network segmentation</strong>, which is the right way to go. Let's refine the plan based on your remarks and add some structured suggestions.</p>

<h3 id="-1-attacker-machine"><a class="header" href="#-1-attacker-machine">🧨 <strong>1. Attacker Machine</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Use case</strong>: Simulate <em>external threat actor</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>VM</strong>: Kali Linux with XFCE (GUI tools like Burp, Metasploit, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Network</strong>: Should be <strong>outside of the internal LAN</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put on a separate virtual <strong>bridge</strong> (e.g., <code>br-attack</code>).</li>
<li>This bridge should connect to the <strong>external interface</strong> of the firewall/router VM.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Use case</strong>: Secure VM for <strong>managing</strong> the lab and <strong>monitoring</strong> it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Tools</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSH keys for admin tasks</li>
<li>Ansible for automation</li>
<li>Splunk/Syslog/SOC tools (Falco, Wazuh, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>🧩 <strong>Suggestion</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>separate user accounts</strong> for <code>admin</code> and <code>soc</code>.</li>
<li>Or if you're comfortable: use 2 VMs for cleaner isolation, but resource cost increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Location</strong>: Place it in a <strong>management VLAN</strong>, only reachable through firewall.</p>

<h3 id="-3-firewall-vm"><a class="header" href="#-3-firewall-vm">🔥 <strong>3. Firewall VM</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Use case</strong>: Route + filter all inter-segment traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Distro</strong>: <strong>Alpine</strong> is a strong choice — lightweight, hardened, reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Network Setup</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>eth0</code>: connected to attacker net (<code>br-attack</code>)</li>
<li><code>eth1</code>: connected to internal LAN (<code>br-int</code>)</li>
<li>Optional <code>eth2</code>: management interface to admin VM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tools</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<hr />
<p>Would you like help creating bridge setup + QEMU launch scripts + Suricata config for Alpine next?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Temporary internet via NAT for setup only
For quick package installation:
Temporarily attach a VM to a QEMU NAT network for updates.
Disconnect it after updates are done and reconnect to lab LAN.
This avoids having a permanent internet path in the lab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Host OS
Runs QEMU and your VMs.
Not part of the lab network (isolated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firewall VM (Alpine, 2+ NICs)
WAN NIC → Connected to a QEMU NAT network (this simulates the "internet" in your lab).
This is where updates and external tools can be downloaded.
In your simulation, the attacker's side connects here.
LAN NIC(s) → Connected to lab bridges (br0, br1, etc.).
These are your "company networks" with VLANs inside.
The firewall:
Acts as border firewall for your company network.
Routes traffic between attacker and company LAN.
Can apply NAT, ACLs, firewall rules (nftables/iptables).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker VM
Connected to the WAN side of the Firewall VM.
This makes the attacker “outside” the company, just like an internet-based attacker.
Must break through firewall to reach inside network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bridges
On the LAN side of the firewall you can have one or more bridges:
Example: br0 with VLAN 10 (Finance) and VLAN 20 (HR).
Example: br1 with VLAN 30 (SOC/Admin).
Bridges simulate network switches, VLANs simulate segmentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realism in simulation
In the real world, an attacker doesn't “find” the firewall — they just know they are outside, and the firewall is the company’s border with the internet.
Your WAN-side bridge (with attacker) is the simulated internet.
Your firewall’s LAN side is the protected internal company network.</p>

<p>For this project I use this Operating Systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debian</li>
<li>Kali Linux 2025.2</li>
<li>Alpine</li>
</ul>
<p>🔐 Security zones (e.g., DMZ, internal, admin, SOC) are isolated — you can simulate this with separate VMs.
💻 Different roles (attacker, user, admin, firewall, router) usually run on different physical or virtual machines.
🔄 VMs let you snapshot, test, restore, and repeat — a crucial part of both blue-team and red-team workflows.
🌐 Network segmentation is key to enterprise defense — best simulated using bridges, NAT, VLANs, or virtual switches (like VDE or QEMU’s built-in network modes).</p>
<p>✅ 2. Suggested Attack Categories (Vectors)
Pick from these based on what you'd like to simulate:
Attack Type	Vector	Tools You Might Use	Requires GUI?
Reconnaissance	Passive or Active scanning	nmap, dnsenum, theHarvester	No
Phishing	Email-based social engineering	Gophish, custom web pages	Often yes
Exploitation	Web or network service	Metasploit, sqlmap, burpsuite	GUI useful
Credential Attack	Brute force, password reuse	hydra, john, hashcat, medusa	No (CLI works)
Pivoting	Post-exploitation movement	proxychains, sshuttle, impacket	No

<p><strong>Pass-the-Hash / Credential Reuse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> Use same local password hash in two VMs. Once attacker compromises one, try to SSH into the other.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Spot unusual SSH logins from wrong subnets.</li>
<li><strong>Why important:</strong> Credential reuse is very common in real companies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulated Data Theft</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> Put “sensitive” files in Finance dept. Simulate sending them out to the attacker over an allowed port (e.g., HTTPS).</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Learn to detect unusual outbound traffic in Suricata logs.</li>
<li><strong>Why important:</strong> Most security teams fail to catch outbound exfiltration early.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Why? Resource heavy, but worth learning at small scale.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>Service Flooding (DoS)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What:</strong> Run a small-scale SYN flood against one service to see how it’s logged.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create firewall rate-limiting rules.</li>
<li><strong>Why important:</strong> Even small DoS events can cause disruptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>💡 <strong>Mentor’s Advice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <strong>Phase 1</strong> and <strong>Phase 2</strong> — they require no internet, low resources, and teach 80% of what matters in real network security.</li>
<li>Keep logs from every attack in SOC — these become your <strong>incident reports</strong> for documentation.</li>
<li>Only move to Phase 3 and 4 once you’re comfortable spotting attacks in logs.</li>
</ul>
