# Network Topology

🔄 Next Questions to Think About
What VM tool do you use to wire networking? QEMU bridges + tap? virt-manager? custom script?
Do you want to simulate Internet access (with NAT)?
Do you want to test IDS/IPS tools (e.g., Suricata)?
Do you want VLANs to be real (802.1Q) or simulated (software separated)?
Will you monitor from the host (Wireshark, etc.)?


Excellent direction — you’re clearly aligning this with **realistic enterprise-like network segmentation**, which is the right way to go. Let's refine the plan based on your remarks and add some structured suggestions.

## 🔍 Updated VM Use Cases + Recommendations

### 🧨 **1. Attacker Machine**

* ✅ **Use case**: Simulate *external threat actor*.
* ✅ **VM**: Kali Linux with XFCE (GUI tools like Burp, Metasploit, etc.).
* ✅ **Network**: Should be **outside of the internal LAN**.

  * Put on a separate virtual **bridge** (e.g., `br-attack`).
  * This bridge should connect to the **external interface** of the firewall/router VM.

**✅ Realism Check:** ✔️ This models how real attacks happen — from external Internet or unknown zones.

---

### 👨‍💻 **2. Admin + SOC Machine (Debian + XFCE)**

* ✅ **Use case**: Secure VM for **managing** the lab and **monitoring** it.
* ✅ **Tools**:

  * SSH keys for admin tasks
  * Ansible for automation
  * Splunk/Syslog/SOC tools (Falco, Wazuh, etc.)
* 🧩 **Suggestion**:

  * Use **separate user accounts** for `admin` and `soc`.
  * Or if you're comfortable: use 2 VMs for cleaner isolation, but resource cost increases.
* ✅ **Location**: Place it in a **management VLAN**, only reachable through firewall.

---

### 🔥 **3. Firewall VM**

* ✅ **Use case**: Route + filter all inter-segment traffic.
* ✅ **Distro**: **Alpine** is a strong choice — lightweight, hardened, reliable.
* ✅ **Network Setup**:

  * `eth0`: connected to attacker net (`br-attack`)
  * `eth1`: connected to internal LAN (`br-int`)
  * Optional `eth2`: management interface to admin VM

**Tools**:

* Use `nftables` or `iptables` (or both if Alpine has legacy support).
* Install **Suricata or Snort** here. See next section.

### 🧪 **4. IDS/IPS Choice: Suricata vs. Snort**

| Feature     | **Suricata** | **Snort**        |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| License     | GPLv2        | GPLv2            |
| Multithread | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No             |
| Protocols   | Layer 7 DPI  | Mainly Layer 3/4 |
| Performance | Fast, modern | Legacy-style     |
| Output      | JSON, EVE    | Unified2         |

✅ **Recommendation**: Use **Suricata** — especially since you're familiar with it already, and it's better suited for modern traffic inspection.

**Placement**: Install on **firewall VM** to inspect both inbound and outbound traffic.

---

### 🌐 **5. Router VM**

* ✅ **Use case**: Simulate *Internet access* or *inter-office routing*.
* 💡 Suggestion:

  * Combine **firewall + router** role into **one Alpine-based VM**.
  * NAT + DNS forwarding + DHCP server for lab subnets.
  * You can create **3 NICs**:

    * `eth0`: *external network (attacker/Internet simulation)*
    * `eth1`: *internal lab subnet*
    * `eth2`: *optional management interface*

---

### 🖥️ **6. Departmental VMs (5x)**

* ✅ **Use case**: Employees in various departments.
* Examples:

  * HR
  * Dev
  * Finance
  * Sales
  * R\&D
* 💡 Suggestion: Assign **separate VLAN/subnet** to each.
* ✅ Harden them differently depending on risk level.
* Use **Ansible** for initial provisioning.
* Add **logging agents** (rsyslog, Filebeat, etc.) to forward logs to SOC.

---

### 🧠 Suggested Additions

#### 🔐 PKI & Vault

* Set up **GPG or age-encrypted password vault** for managing:

  * Admin SSH keys
  * Preseed passwords
  * Ansible vault secrets
* Optionally: use `pass` + GPG or `ansible-vault`.

#### 🛜 DHCP/DNS

* Decide who will provide these:

  * Alpine firewall?
  * Or separate ISC DHCP + unbound DNS?

#### 📡 Monitoring

* Consider adding a **monitoring VM** (Prometheus/Grafana/Netdata).
* Tap internal traffic (e.g., use a port mirror bridge if supported).

## ✅ Your Revised Network Layout

```
       ┌─────────────┐
       │ Attacker VM │
       └────┬────────┘
            │ (br-attack)
       ┌────▼─────┐
       │ Firewall │  ← Suricata, NAT, Routing
       └┬────┬────┘
    ┌───┘    └──────────┐
    │                   │
┌──▼──────┐     ┌───────▼─────┐
│ Internal LAN │   │ Management VLAN │

## 🔧 What You Can Work on Next

1. **Bridge creation** in QEMU for `br-int`, `br-attack`, `br-mgmt`.
2. Setup **Alpine firewall/router** with:

   * NAT
   * Routing
   * Suricata
   * Static IPs for VMs
3. Define **subnets**:

   * e.g. `192.168.10.0/24` for internal
   * `192.168.20.0/24` for mgmt
   * `192.168.99.0/24` for attacker net
4. Start writing **QEMU scripts** to launch each VM and attach to proper bridges.
