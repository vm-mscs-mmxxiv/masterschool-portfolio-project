# Network and Data Stage

Timeline/Schedule: 2-3 days.

1. Introduction/Background - Context and purpose
2. Scope of Work - What will and won't be included
3. Tasks/Deliverables - Specific work activities and outcomes
4. Timeline/Schedule - Project phases and milestones
5. Performance Standards - Quality and acceptance criteria
6. Reporting Requirements - Status updates and documentation
7. Resources/Responsibilities - Who provides what
8. Terms and Conditions - Legal and contractual aspects

This Stage focuses on two things: 

- comprehensive network inspection and security hardening
- secure data handling procedures

Cable infrastructure assessment will require third-party contractor expertise to ensure proper installation and security compliance. Upon completion of this stage, the office network topology must be fully operational and documented.

The Security Operations Center (SOC) must be fully operational by the end of this stage, and all end-host machines must be configured and ready for production use.

## Scope of Work

**Network**

- Third-party cable infrastructure certification
- Update network topology
- Completed network security hardening
- Update  network topology documentation

**End-hosts**

- Production-ready end-host systems, prioritize departments that operate with sensitive data and are commonly in use
- Implement IaC (keep in mind that company will grow)

**Cybersecurity Operations**

- Establich fully operational SOC

----

- understand Data in the company, levels and specification
- Data, Owner, Processor, Custodians. Data handling.
- Data segmentation
- third party physical ispection of the cables for tapping
- deeper inspection and hardening of key network devices 
- build network topology
- implement SOC Center, configure servers for logs and etc.
- update isntall configure end hosts according to their roles, prioritize these in departments that operate with sensitive data and are commonly in use.
- Contimue with host hardening. make sure that uprotected hosts are not connected to lan




## Tasks/Deliverables

**1. Data Management**

The company provides data-driven services and maintains critical concerns regarding information protection. Data management represents a fundamental priority requiring comprehensive strategic planning and implementation.

During this stage, optimal strategies for data processing, transfer, and protection must be established. The primary focus addresses essential questions of data stewardship: who has access, what data requires protection, and how data flows through organizational systems. A comprehensive data management baseline must be documented to provide the foundation for network topology design and role-based access configuration on end-host systems.

**Stage Objectives:**


**Future Implementation:**

Subsequent stages will implement data backup solutions and cloud-based processing capabilities, utilizing the established baselines and procedures to address advanced data management requirements and ensure comprehensive data governance.
