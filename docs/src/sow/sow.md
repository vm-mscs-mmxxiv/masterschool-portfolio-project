# Statement of Work

This section is intended to serve as a SOW. At the same time, it can be considered a schedule of tasks. I tried to make this section as clear and concise as possible, but due to time constraints and my ongoing learning process, this section is the most volatile of all.

During our discussions with senior executives, several areas lacked clarity regarding current security measures. Where specific protections, documentation, or management processes were not explicitly mentioned, I have assumed they may not be fully implemented or documented.

This section will focus more on managerial controls than technical controls. Therefore, it will mostly be documentation. The documentation for implementing the technical controls is in the Setup section.

**Framework and Methodology**

This cybersecurity implementation will utilize the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 as the foundational standard. All key principles and activities Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This activities will be executed in accordance with this framework's guidelines and best practices.

**Project Structure and Timeline**

The Baseline Analysis section provides a description of the current state and expectations that senior executives wish to achieve. This work has been organized by priority timeline, as certain security implementations require more immediate attention than others.

**Project Context**

For operational continuity, existing security operations shall continue as normal during implementation. This SOW is structured around a complete office relocation scenario to provide comprehensive security implementation guidance without the complexity of describing temporary protection measures during incremental upgrades.

## Risks, Threats, Comliance

Below is a list of threats / suggestions that I would purpose to executives in follow up meeting. Some I would investigate by myself some probably would stay in this list.

- After proper Inventory is ready. Protect and mitigate.
- Create areas where all non-employees are allowed. Make sure that unauthorized person can access other areas in the Office.
- Restrict physical access to secured areas, use tamper-evident measures to inspect unauthorized access to cables. Inspect this areas for unautorized access regularly.
- InfoSec plans, tolerance, risk acceptance and complience
- Need security team SOC.
- Key and password escrow
- Email services by third party organization.
- Need more planning on BYOD, MDM, Cloud Services
- Change Advisory Board (CAB) need proper assignment
