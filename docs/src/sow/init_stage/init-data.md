# Initial Stage - Data

During this stage, all methods of data retention, transfer, and collection must be identified and documented. The security team must know about anything that workers use for the purpose of working with date , even scraps of paper on the table.

The data landscape is complex across the company. There is sensible data, as well as data subject to regulatory compliance. This must all be planned at this stage so that appropriate security measures can be established later to protect the data.

At the same time, the security team began collecting data, so this data must also be stored. Check all end hosts and servers. Check the network segmentation and the configuration of the networks. Are the hosts hardened? Do the end hosts have an adequate level of protection? What type of encryption is in use? Begin planning for cloud-based solutions. Address compliance-related issues as well. Find out what backup plans are in use and how they are implemented.

## Scope of Work

- Create Data Inventory
- Assign Data related roles to appropriete employees
- Document all relevant roles, from documentatio it must be clear who is responsible for what and what access level do employees have.
- Plan data segmentation. There are situations when access level must be lower depending on location. That means some employee can access more sensitive data while in the office, but would stick with less sensitive data if connected from outside from the Office.
- Asses state of protection for end-hosts and servers
- Find out what paths do data go when transfered, are the way of transfering data secure
- Find out how Data is classified. What measures are in place to protect highly sensible Data
- How compliant are operations with the Data in the Office
- Check compliance requirement documentation and ask Compliance Officer for specific requirements
- What backup system is in use
- Plan for any required update to office infrostructure, document this plans
