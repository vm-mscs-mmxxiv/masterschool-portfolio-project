# Identify - Network

Initial network topology and cabling infrastructure must be completed and documented. The Company occupies ground and second floors. There is a whole floor between our flors that mean that cables can be tampered there to install taps. It is hard to protect something that you do not controll. At the moment company do not controll the whole floor between our network. Phisical inspection shall be conducted.

## Scope of Work

- Inspect network capboards
- Third-party cable infrastructure certification
- Document current  network topology
- Plan network topology account for this measures:
    - Network Segmentation
    - VPN for Inter-Floor Connectivity
    - Wi-Fi Segmenataion and protection
    - End-to-End Encryption (encryption for all company devices including laptops and mobile phones)
    - Plan the Network for Multi-layer Security.
- Update  network topology documentation
- Employee Training
- Plan Regular Audits

## Tasks

**1. Cable Infrostructure**

Inspecting physical cables for wiretaps and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks is a highly specialized area of security. It's often referred to as Technical Surveillance Counter-Measures (TSCM).
A proper physical inspection for taps and MITM attacks is not a DIY job. It requires a combination of strong physical security, a systematic visual inspection, and the use of professional, specialized tools like a TDR. For critical infrastructure, this is often performed by trained TSCM specialists who are experts in finding both passive and active surveillance devices.

- All server rooms, wiring closets, and data centers should be locked and monitored.
- Cable Management: All cables should be organized and secured, ideally in sealed conduits or raceways. Any loose, unorganized, or unlabeled cables should be investigated. Watch for access points in common areas.
- Look for Tampering: Inspect all cables for any signs of tampering. This includes:
    - Strange splices or connectors: Look for unexpected splices, T-junctions, or any non-standard connectors. An unauthorized tap often involves a splice where the cable's jacket has been cut and wires have been attached.
    - Unusual devices: Look for small, unidentifiable devices attached to the cable or hidden nearby. Modern taps can be the size of a small USB stick or a cigarette pack.
    - Discrepancies in cable length: A physical tap may require a longer-than-expected cable run to connect to the attacker's device.

**Using Specialized Tools to detect Taps**

A simple visual inspection is often not enough, as many taps are designed to be covert. Proper inspection requires specialized equipment that can analyze the physical and electrical properties of the cable.

- Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to  detect physical taps.
- Network Testers and Certifiers.
- Cable Tracing and Mapping: Tools like tone generators and probes.

**Wi-Fi**

Wi-Fi is common attack vector. By the nature of wireless connection it is often possibl to gain access into cvomapnieses network without physical breach and sometimes even without having access to the building.

- Mapping of hot spots and their ACLs and autorization setups required.
- Check for admin access, encryption in use, network separation, passwords. Consider to update devices or change them to less restricted areas if they are outdated. Latest level of encryption suitable for comercial use is WPA3-Enterprise-192.
- Test / audit if someone can connect to your Wi-Fi from outside even without physical access.

**Network Topology**

- Document  required update / upgrade network devices
