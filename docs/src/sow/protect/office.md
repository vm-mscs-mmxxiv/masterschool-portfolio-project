- Implement administrative measures

## Tasks

### Physical Departmental Security

Office Segmentation and Access Control Review: Evaluate physical separation of different business functions and security zones within the office environment. Document access restrictions between departments, visitor access protocols, and isolation of sensitive areas (server rooms, executive offices, HR areas). Assess effectiveness of physical barriers, badge/key card systems, and identification of unauthorized personnel in restricted zones.

Physical separation between departments provides essential protection for sensitive work by improving focus and reducing risks of shoulder surfing, inadvertent data exposure, and unauthorized eavesdropping in confidential areas. Cost-effective solutions such as modular partitions or demountable walls can create effective visual and acoustic barriers. This separation is particularly critical for Finance, Human Resources, Compliance, client-specific project teams, and the cybersecurity team.

Address security findings made in Identify Stage.

### Visitors and Contractors Access Control Policy

Access to the office for all non-employees, including visitors and contractors, must adhere to the company's Access Control Policy to ensure the physical and logical security of our premises and data.

**Visitor Access:**

- **Permitted Areas:** Visitor access is strictly limited to the lobby and designated meeting rooms.
- **Procedure:** All visitors are required to sign in at the front desk and will be provided with a visitor badge, which must be worn at all times.
- **Escort:** Visitors are not permitted to move freely and must be escorted by an employee at all times while within the office premises.
- **Network Access:** Visitors are only allowed to connect to a designated, segregated guest network. Access to the corporate network is strictly prohibited.
-

**Contractor Access:**

- **Access Level:** Contractor access will be provisioned on a **least privilege** basis, granting them only the minimum access necessary to fulfill their contractual obligations.
- **Governing Documents:** Access for contractors is governed by a formal contract, which must include a signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for those handling sensitive data. This contract dictates the specific access levels, permitted systems, and data handling procedures.
- **Identification:** Contractors must be identified through a pre-assigned badge or credential, which should be distinguishable from employee credentials.
- **Physical and Logical Boundaries:** Contractor access to sensitive areas and systems will be restricted based on their role and documented in their contract. Access to the core corporate network, administrative systems, and confidential data is prohibited unless explicitly required and authorized. All contractor activity will be monitored and audited as required by security policy.

**Specific attention to:**

- **Highly sensible area access:** Areas containing servers, network devices, financial data processing systems, or HIPAA-like protected data must have enhanced protection against unauthorized access. Access to these areas shall require at least two different authentication factors, such as a password and a security key.
- **Visitors and Lobby Area:** Visitors are not allowed to walk into the Office Areas. Any devices in this area shall be outside of companieses network. Essentially Visitors and Lobby are confined areas totally sand-boxed from the Office.
- **Window Security:** Assess whether existing windows provide adequate visual protection against external surveillance using optical equipment. Consider privacy films or treatments where necessary to prevent external observation of sensitive work areas.
- **Infrastructure Considerations:** Physical modifications must not interfere with Wi-Fi coverage or disrupt existing network cabling. Layout changes should preserve existing infrastructure wherever possible to minimize implementation costs and downtime.
- **Safety Compliance:** All separation plans must maintain clear pathways and unobstructed line-of-sight to emergency exits to ensure compliance with fire safety and building codes.
- **Video Surveillance Assessment:** Document all surveillance camera locations, coverage areas, recording capabilities, and access controls. Identify who has administrative access to camera systems, viewing permissions, and data retention policies. Assess potential security vulnerabilities including camera network isolation, default credentials, firmware currency, and physical tampering protection. Evaluate surveillance systems as potential attack vectors for network infiltration.
- **Implement administrative measures:** Clearly designate restricted areas within the office at all times. Access to these areas must be controlled and visibly marked, and strict sanctions should be enforced in cases of non-compliance.
