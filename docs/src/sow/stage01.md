# Stage 1

Timeline/Schedule: 2-3 days.

1. Introduction/Background - Context and purpose
2. Scope of Work - What will and won't be included
3. Tasks/Deliverables - Specific work activities and outcomes
4. Timeline/Schedule - Project phases and milestones
5. Performance Standards - Quality and acceptance criteria
6. Reporting Requirements - Status updates and documentation
7. Resources/Responsibilities - Who provides what
8. Terms and Conditions - Legal and contractual aspects

This stage encompasses initial inspection and addresses critical issues related to office physical segmentation, protection, and surveillance systems. Upon completion of Stage, the physical office setup must be finalized with appropriate departmental separation, and office floors must be fully prepared for business operations. Initial network topology and cabling infrastructure must be completed and documented. Asset inventory and threat management systems must be operational and ready for ongoing security management.

## Scope of Work

- Complete physical security assessment
- Implemented office segmentation solutions
- Secured surveillance system configuration
- Documented network topology and infrastructure
- Operational inventory management system
- Threat tracking and vulnerability management system

## Tasks/Deliverables

**1. Power Supply**

> IMPORTANT!!!
> The building itself has a central generator that supports life-safety systems (emergency lighting, elevators, fire control).
> 
> **Central Generator does not power tenant IT infrastructure.** For full operational continuity, we would need either:
> 
> - A tenant-specific generator connection, or
> - An arrangement with building management to tie our circuits into the central generator.

**2. Physical Departmental Security**

Office Segmentation and Access Control Review: Evaluate physical separation of different business functions and security zones within the office environment. Document access restrictions between departments, visitor access protocols, and isolation of sensitive areas (server rooms, executive offices, HR areas). Assess effectiveness of physical barriers, badge/key card systems, and identification of unauthorized personnel in restricted zones.

- Conduct physical security assessment through comprehensive site inspection, identifying potential vulnerabilities and non-compliance issues with applicable security frameworks.
- Create detailed floor plan diagrams documenting current office layout, including physical entry points, host machine locations, and network connectivity mapping.
- Document all security findings with photographic evidence and detailed descriptions for remediation tracking.
- Address security findings

Physical separation between departments provides essential protection for sensitive work by improving focus and reducing risks of shoulder surfing, inadvertent data exposure, and unauthorized eavesdropping in confidential areas. Cost-effective solutions such as modular partitions or demountable walls can create effective visual and acoustic barriers. This separation is particularly critical for Finance, Human Resources, Compliance, client-specific project teams, and the cybersecurity team.

**Specific attention must be payed to:**

- **Window Security:** Assess whether existing windows provide adequate visual protection against external surveillance using optical equipment. Consider privacy films or treatments where necessary to prevent external observation of sensitive work areas.
- **Infrastructure Considerations:** Physical modifications must not interfere with Wi-Fi coverage or disrupt existing network cabling. Layout changes should preserve existing infrastructure wherever possible to minimize implementation costs and downtime.
- **Safety Compliance:** All separation plans must maintain clear pathways and unobstructed line-of-sight to emergency exits to ensure compliance with fire safety and building codes.
- **Video Surveillance Assessment:** Document all surveillance camera locations, coverage areas, recording capabilities, and access controls. Identify who has administrative access to camera systems, viewing permissions, and data retention policies. Assess potential security vulnerabilities including camera network isolation, default credentials, firmware currency, and physical tampering protection. Evaluate surveillance systems as potential attack vectors for network infiltration.

**3. Digital Inventory Systems**

Effective asset management requires a comprehensive inventory system to track device locations, user access controls, system configurations, software installations, and operational status across all office equipment and infrastructure. For the company of this size on-premise solution is enough. Key points to keep in mind for the System:

- On-premise solutions
- Role-based access controls
- Integration with vulnerability management tools
- Multi-factor authentication for access
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular backups (automated)
- Access logging and monitoring
- Network segmentation from general corporate network

**4. Vulnerability Management Systems**

Effective cybersecurity requires a centralized vulnerability management system to track security weaknesses, assess risk levels, monitor remediation progress, assign accountability, and maintain compliance with security frameworks.

Key point for the Vulnerability Register:

- Often separate from general IT asset management
- Higher classification level due to sensitive security data
- Real-time vulnerability feeds and threat intelligence integration
- Stricter network isolation - Often air-gapped or on separate security network
- Higher encryption standards - Contains exploitable vulnerability details
- Enhanced logging - Every access tracked for compliance
- Role-based access (view-only for most, edit for security team)
- Audit trails for all changes
- Secure backup procedures

## Resources/Responsibilities

- **Power Supply:** Cooperation between building management and COO is required
- **Video Surveillance Assessment:** Cooperation between building management and COO
- **Physical security, office segmentation:** Third party construction contractors, CFO (will require funding to buy materials and pay contractor)
- **Documented network topology and infrastructure:** IT Support and Security Team
- **Operational inventory management system:** IT Support and Security Team
- **Threat tracking and vulnerability management system:** IT Support and Security Team
