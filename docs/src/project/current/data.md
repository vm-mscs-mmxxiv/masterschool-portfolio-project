# Data

- Client contracts, proposals, and strategic plans
- Financial records, banking details, and payment card data
- Operational blueprints, supplier contracts, and project schedules
- Employee personal data (SSNs, addresses, health benefit info, so PII and SPII) stored in HRIS and payroll systems.
- Compliance audit logs, access control records, and incident reports — stored in secured, tamper-evident systems.
* Redundancy for logging, several levels of logging with different sensitivity.
* data transfer regulations.
* Encrypted storage and transmission, retention policies aligned with regulations.

[CEO – Alex]

Client contracts, proposals, and strategic plans — usually stored in our document management system and shared via secure portals. These must be quickly retrievable during negotiations.
Strong encryption and controlled sharing to prevent leaks
Loss or theft could cause competitive disadvantage.
Client trust is our currency. We deal with confidential client data regularly—keeping that protected is vital.

COO-Casey

 Operational blueprints, supplier contracts, and project schedules — stored on internal servers and cloud collaboration platforms.
 • Performance Needs: Must be accessible to distributed teams without bottlenecks.
 • Security/Compliance Needs: Role-based permissions and secure file sharing.

Yes, external partners often need limited access—to shared drives, project tools, or documentation. Segmented, task-specific access is essential. Zero trust: verify everything, restrict everything. No backdoors. I need clear visibility into who has access, for what, and for how long. Manual tracking is too error-prone.

Morgan

Compliance audit logs, access control records, and incident reports — stored in secured, tamper-evident systems
Real-time logging, encryption at rest and in transit, and incident response processes that meet audit standards. Need a DRP (disaster recovery plan), playbooks.
Encryption, immutability, and geographically diverse backups.
Sensitive info must never transit insecurely.
