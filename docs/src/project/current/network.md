# Office Networking

Don't assume we have wiring everywhere—we may need to retrofit. Employees need uninterrupted access to systems regardless of floor or location.

On-site staff need stable LAN and Wi-Fi, while remote teams rely on cloud tools, VPNs, and video calls
Remote users: financial, sales, IT. Often connect from public networks.
Guests connect from conference rooms or lobby areas. Limit guests to internet-only access.

* network segregation
* VPN access
* Sudden spikes occur
* Keep meeting rooms smart boards, video conferencing systems, and digital signage isolated from sensitive business systems and must be always available.
* Downtime should not expose data or cause loss of in-progress work
* Accounting and ERP ( Enterprise Resource Planning) access must be resilient to network issues.

CEO-Alex

Consider redundancy for internet and key services. Assume we’re growing—we’ll need a network that scales with minimal friction.
The network is a strategic asset, not just overhead—so I’ll invest in scalable, growth-ready infrastructure if you justify the business case.
Make sure it can handle more users and new apps without major rework. Pay now to avoid pain later.
Avoid penny-wise, pound-foolish. I don’t want to revisit this in 12 months because we cut corners.
Success means the network helps us scale and innovate faster—supporting new hires, new services, or locations without friction.
The network must support scalable growth—if we double headcount or spin up a new location, it shouldn't require a full rework.
I want the network to accommodate future M&A or expansion—don’t make it department-specific to the point of rigidity.

 We’ll need a network that can scale seamlessly across new floors or buildings without a full redesign.
• Security/Compliance Needs: The network must maintain segregation between secure zones, even if we're spread across multiple floors or suites.
• Concerns / Notes: Assume relocation is a possibility—design the network to be modular and portable. Avoid overly complex infrastructure tied to one location.

The network must support secure inter-office communication (e.g., VPNs or SD-WAN), while still being flexible enough to adapt if we grow faster than expected.

COO-Casey

Segregate operational tech from main office network to prevent cross-impact.
Internal collaboration tools must scale to handle surge in file transfers and communications.
Assume variable internet quality. The solution should degrade gracefully and avoid requiring super-fast connections.

We may need to onboard project-based contractors quickly (e.g., for acquisitions or product launches). The network must support rapid user expansion without manual config.
• Performance Needs: Network performance must stay consistent during traffic bursts—especially with AI pipelines or large file transfers.
• Security/Compliance Needs: Isolated environments for pilot projects would help reduce risk.
• Concerns / Notes: Plan for sudden load changes—a new acquisition could double our traffic overnight.

Morgan

The network must support audit readiness, access logs, and retention policies.
If we allow external users—vendors, contractors, etc.—they must be restricted to the minimum access required for their task. No broad network access.
Any access from outside the org must comply with our regulatory environment. External access is a high-risk vector if mismanaged.
