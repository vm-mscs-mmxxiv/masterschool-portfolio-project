# The Office

The Office is a mix of open workspaces, private offices, meeting rooms. At the moment Company rents ground and second floors of the building, roughly 557 square meters each. Staff are split between on-site and remote. Currently, about 60% of employees are on-site, 40% remote. This  expect to shift closer to 50/50 as more distributed talent hired.

About 70 staff in the office daily, 30 remote, 10–15 contractors split between on-site and remote. The building has been audited and certified within the last 12 months to accommodate highly data-sensitive operations. This includes compliance with relevant building security standards, controlled access, and infrastructure resilience requirements. Certificates are on file and available for inspection.

Currently, there is no dedicated generator for any of our suites.
UPS[^2] are installed for critical systems—including the server room, networking equipment, and key workstations in **Finance, HR, and Compliance**. They provide short-term power during outages to allow for safe shutdown or switchover. It is no clear what plans are for installing or leasing a power from generator which is on the site and used to support emergency systems.

Network cable capboards are somehow protected though it is not clear how and to what level of compliance. Physical cable routes should be secured, inspected regularly, and access-limited to authorized staff or contractors. It is not clear what level of audit was performed for a cable infrostructure and CFO has asked to cut down on the cost of rewiring, if possible, especially under the expectancy of office movement to different site.  Regular physical cable inspections are critical—tampering, wiretaps, or unauthorized rerouting must be detectable.

Dayly activities of office stuff include this services: email, file sharing, inventory management, CRM[^1] tools, and communication platforms like Slack or Teams.  For HR Department: HR systems (payroll, benefits, onboarding portals), video. For Secuirty:  Logging, and controls, compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories.

The server room is badge-access only, and our main entrance requires electronic access. Visitor sign-in is manual for now and  managed at reception. There is no clear separation of employees and departments. Some of the premises are protected and secure, but mostly the office is an open space.

Executives have agreed that: sensitive areas should be out of casual view, especially when clients tour the office. Modular and reconfigurable walls are ideal since we’re planning for future expansion or possible relocation. The board of executives urged to choose infrastructure that’s efficient, not overbuilt though - the Office may relocate within one year. Separation should not block Wi-Fi or disrupt network cabling—plan layout changes with IT in mind. Physical barriers reduce the risk of shoulder surfing, casual data exposure, and unauthorized listening in sensitive areas. For departments handling confidential data (Finance, HR, Compliance, Client Project Rooms), physical separation is not optional. Ensure secure storage for paper records within each department’s zone. Consider lockable filing cabinets and privacy screens in addition to physical partitions. 

There  is a video surveillance on the site. Responsiblity for retention and protection of the Video Data is part of companie's operation.

Much of the value of the Company comes from speed, responsiveness, and reliability. Team collaborates heavily across offices and remote setups.

Flexibility supports talent retention and recruitment. The system should empower remote work, not make people miss the office. No major drop in productivity. They should feel like they’re “at the office” even if they’re in another time zone.
Any hiccups in remote access hurt morale and momentum. Smooth remote access is a competitive advantage
External access should support partnerships, deals, or client success—but only when necessary. It should feel professional—no clunky portals or awkward handoffs.

Additionaly meeting rooms have smart boards, video conferencing systems, and digital signage that must always be available for client-facing sessions. These devices need high-quality, low-latency connections for presentations and calls.

There are payment terminals, point-of-sale, self-service kiosks from different third party providers. There also are payment terminals for event transactions and occasional point-of-sale setups for partner demos that required by company stuff.
