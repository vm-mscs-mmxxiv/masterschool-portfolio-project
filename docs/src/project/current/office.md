# The Office

The Office is a mix of open workspaces, private offices, meeting rooms at ground floor and a server/storage room on the second floor. Staff are split between on-site and remote, with around 40 people regularly in the office. The server room is badge-access only, and our main entrance requires electronic access. Visitor sign-in is manual for now and  managed at reception. Currently, about 60% on-site, 40% remote. This  expect to shift closer to 50/50 as more distributed talent hired.

The building has been audited and certified within the last 12 months to accommodate highly data-sensitive operations. This includes compliance with relevant building security standards, controlled access, and infrastructure resilience requirements. Certificates are on file and available for inspection.

Dayly activities of office stuff include this services: Email, file sharing, inventory management, CRM[^1] tools, and communication platforms like Slack or Teams.  HR systems (payroll, benefits, onboarding portals), video. Logging, and controls, compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories.

Currently, there is no dedicated generator for our suite.
UPS[^2] are installed for critical systems—including the server room, networking equipment, and key workstations in **Finance, HR, and Compliance**. They provide short-term power during outages to allow for safe shutdown or switchover.


About 70 staff in the office daily, 30 remote, 10–15 contractors split between on-site and remote. Guests connect from conference rooms or lobby areas. Mix of full-time, part-time, and contract workers connecting from office, home, and occasionally overseas.


our meeting rooms have smart boards, video conferencing systems, and digital signage that must always be available for client-facing sessions.
 • Performance Needs: These devices need high-quality, low-latency connections for presentations and calls.
 Payment terminals for event transactions and occasional point-of-sale setups for partner demos.
 • Performance Needs: Must maintain secure, always-on connectivity to payment processors.

CEO – Alex

Flexibility supports talent retention and recruitment. The system should empower remote work, not make people miss the office. No major drop in productivity. They should feel like they’re “at the office” even if they’re in another time zone.
Any hiccups in remote access hurt morale and momentum. Smooth remote access is a competitive advantage
External access should support partnerships, deals, or client success—but only when necessary. It should feel professional—no clunky portals or awkward handoffs.
Choose infrastructure that’s efficient, not overbuilt

Much of our value comes from speed, responsiveness, and reliability. Our team collaborates heavily across offices and remote setups.
Sensitive areas should be out of casual view, especially when clients tour the office. Modular and reconfigurable walls are ideal since we’re planning for future expansion or possible relocation.

COO-Casey

Fewer servers = less to maintain. If cloud or virtualization helps us cut hardware and energy use, great.
