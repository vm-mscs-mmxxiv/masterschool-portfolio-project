# Cybersecurity

Brand reputation is tied to how “buttoned-up” we appear—even physically.

## Phisical
Unauthorized access to kiosks could create HR or privacy issues.
Physical access to employee files (both digital and printed) is tightly controlled. Sensitive areas are locked, and file cabinets are restricted.
The server room is compliant, but other closets or impromptu setups wouldn’t be.

## Autehtication & Autorization

## Network

Ensure that the cabling layout and switch placements don’t expose us to tampering (e.g., unsecured patch panels or wall jacks in public areas).
## Data
## Logging

Real-time identity verification for remote logins.
Video or access log loss during an incident could jeopardize an investigation or audit.
Accurate tracking of who connects, when, and from where — for all categories (staff, contractors, guests).
## Resilience

Critical systems like access control need uptime even during outages.
Availability should not override risk management. A single breach could undo years of client trust.



CEO – Alex

Clear segmentation between employees, contractors, and guests to reduce risk.
Keep meeting room equipment  isolated from sensitive business systems.
Ensure no stray cables, network's jacks, unprotected Wi-Fi.
Ensure no slowdown that might push staff to use unsanctioned tools.
No partial data loss; restore to last known consistent state.
Systems must support secure, compliant collaboration across borders.
Avoid any practice that could be seen as weakening client confidentiality.
We need systems that help us move fast and stay competitive. If security slows us down too much or frustrates staff, we lose productivity and possibly revenue.
Security should be “quiet” when it works—meaning fast logins, smooth access to systems, and minimal roadblocks to collaboration
We don’t want “perfect security” if it paralyzes us.
Security should be “quiet” when it works—meaning fast logins, smooth access to systems, and minimal roadblocks to collaboration
Keep our IP and internal data firewalled off. External users should never be able to “poke around.”
AI initiatives raise new privacy and security risks, especially if we use internal data for training.
As we diversify services, we may need different compliance profiles for different departments.

COO-Casey

Must verify no malicious code remains before bringing systems online
Operational processes need to follow ISO 27001 principles for information security management.
If security slows down workflows (e.g., constant password resets or blocked file access), it directly hits our team’s productivity.
Authentication needs to be strong but not overbearing—multi-factor is fine, but don't make them jump through hoops for every session.
Security is part of operational reliability. Budget for automated patching, backups, monitoring.

Compliance Officer – Morgan

Access to compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories must be uninterrupted. Delays during an audit could lead to penalties.
• Performance Needs: Reliable access logs and audit tools must function at all times—interrupted logging is a red flag.
Usability matters, but compliance comes first. If there’s tension between convenience and security, security wins—but design it smartly.
Enforce data encryption, device security posture checks, and possibly geo-blocking/logging. Sensitive info must never transit insecurely.
account for audit readiness
Budget for periodic audits or third-party reviews.

## Detect, Respond

CEO-Alex

 I expect real-time alerts for major disruptions or data breaches. If it affects customers, reputation, or operations—tell me fast.
I don’t need every detail immediately—just the scope, impact, and who’s on it.  If we’re exposed externally or need to notify customers, I need to be in the loop within 30 minutes. Speed and transparency matter more than polish during an incident.

COO-Casey

For an outage, alert IT operations first, then escalate to leadership depending on duration or scope. We need to triage fast—ideally within 5 minutes of detection.
 If there’s a hint of a breach, IT and Compliance need to be notified immediately, no later than 15 minutes after detection.
Set thresholds—don’t cry wolf over small hiccups, but don’t delay on real threats.

Systems like access control logs, security cameras, and compliance audit servers.
Continuous data recording without interruption; timestamp accuracy is essential.
Security/Compliance Needs: Encrypted storage and transmission, retention policies aligned with regulations.
Backup systems should automatically take over to prevent data gaps.
