CEO-Alex

We’re exploring AI-driven customer tools, which will likely require cloud compute access, fast data exchange, and potentially more traffic between teams. Also, new product lines may add collaboration platforms or partner integrations.
We are actively exploring adding a Business Intelligence or Innovation function to stay ahead in our field. That may mean hiring analysts, data scientists, or even developers.
The setup works for now, but we may move or expand in the next 12–18 months. Design with portability and flexibility in mind.
 Yes, we're planning to expand within the next 12–18 months. We’re evaluating options to either lease a third floor in the current building or relocate to a larger HQ—especially if we add new departments like R&D or Data Analytics. Expansion must not disrupt day-to-day work.

we’re considering regional offices or satellite hubs to support growth and access new talent markets. This might mean splitting into two or three locations within the next 2–3 years. Remote hiring is also driving this decision.
• Performance Needs: Each location must operate autonomously, but stay connected to HQ for collaboration and data access.

COO-Casey

These new sites would likely serve client delivery, sales, or regional support roles. They’ll need access to central systems (CRM, project management, shared drives) and reliable uptime.
• Performance Needs: Performance between offices matters—especially for file transfers, video calls, and real-time collaboration tools.
• Security/Compliance Needs: Each location needs central policy control with localized enforcement—e.g., firewall rules, user access, device management.
