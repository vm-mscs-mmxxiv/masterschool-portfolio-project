# Business Continuity

Operations of the company must run smoothly without delays and glitches. Even a small period of unavailability can cause revenue loss or sunctions. Operational data should not be lost during interruptions.

Companie's tools and servers must to be continuously available to both office and remote staff. Any disruption longer than a few minutes can cascade into delays across departments, especially in client-facing functions. CEO expects 99.9% uptime minimum. Video calls, screen sharing, and large file uploads/downloads should work seamlessly. Systems tied to sales, proposals, and client communications must have near-continuous availability.

HR Director  also said that: "Consistency matters more than speed". Onboarding new hires remotely must be seamless regardless of location.

Access to compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories must be uninterrupted. Delays during an audit could lead to penalties.

Downtime should not expose data or cause loss of in-progress work.
Even short interruptions during negotiations or presentations can cost deals.
The system should be stable and fast, with no business disruption during or after rollout.
Any new department will need scalable support—let’s avoid hard-coding systems that won’t flex.

While uptime is paramount, it must not come at the expense of exposing sensitive operational data or creating backdoors.

Scheduled maintenance should happen off-hours with proper alerts. We need strong business continuity planning, including failover and rapid recovery protocols for outages.
Critical systems like access control need uptime even during outages.
Malfunctions in HVAC or access control could disrupt daily operations.
For core operational systems, more than 20 minutes per month of outage causes workflow delays and service backlogs.
Ensure system performance does not drop under load.
Remote and hybrid staff need seamless, reliable access to core systems, file shares, collaboration tools, internal portals.

## RTO, RPO [^1]

- **CEO:** 
Critical, client-facing apps (**CRM[^2], proposal tools, video conferencing**) must **recover within 15 minutes** to avoid lost deals or missed opportunities.
Recovery should be seamless enough that clients barely notice disruption.
No partial data loss; restore to last known consistent state.
The longer downtime lasts, the greater the risk of clients turning to competitors.         
• RPO: 24 hours acceptable for general business files; critical growth/strategy docs ideally <4 hours.

- **CFO:** 
Financial systems should be **operational again within 30 minutes**, especially during billing cycles.
Ensure restored systems process any backlog quickly.
Recovery must preserve transactional integrity to avoid financial discrepancies.
Extended outages increase the risk of missed payment deadlines.              
• RPO: Accounting, payroll, financial systems ≤4 hrs. Non-critical budget/planning files ≤24 hrs.

- **COO:** 
Operational tools must be **up and running within 20 minutes** to prevent project schedule slippage.
Prioritize restoring collaboration and task management systems before less critical tools.
Must verify no malicious code remains before bringing systems online. Restore from last know good snapshot.
Restarting systems without confirming integrity could cause repeat outages.            
• RPO: Core ops systems (scheduling, client service, inventory) ≤2 hrs. Routine internal docs ≤12 hrs.

- **HR Director:** 
HRIS and payroll should **recover within 1 hour** during normal periods, faster during payroll runs.
Minimal downtime for onboarding systems when sessions are active.
Post-incident, ensure user accounts and permissions are still correct.
Restoring incorrect HR data could cause payroll or benefits errors. Need good clean system.             
• RPO: Employee records, onboarding/offboarding systems ≤4 hrs. HR policies/forms ≤24 hrs.

- **Compliance Officer:** 
Compliance-related logging and audit systems must **recover within 5 minutes** to maintain continuous evidence chains.
Backup systems should automatically take over to prevent data gaps. I need mechanism to detect logging system failure.
Full integrity verification before reconnecting to live environment.
Missing even a few minutes of compliance data can result in regulatory violations.             
• RPO: Regulated data and audit logs = near-zero (≤5 min).

## Resilience, Uptime

- **CEO:** 
Anything over 15 minutes per month of critical system downtime starts to impact client trust and project delivery timelines.
Systems tied to sales, proposals, and client communications must have near-continuous availability.
Downtime should not expose data or cause loss of in-progress work.
Even short interruptions during negotiations or presentations can cost deals.

- **CFO:** 
Over 30 minutes per month affects invoicing, payroll, and financial reporting cycles.
Accounting and ERP[^3] access must be resilient to network issues.
Financial transactions must be protected from corruption if downtime occurs mid-process.
Extended downtime can delay receivables, impacting cash flow.

- **COO:** 
For core operational systems, more than 20 minutes per month of outage causes workflow delays and service backlogs.
Need redundancy so outages don’t stall interdepartmental work.
Operational data should not be lost during interruptions.
Service-level commitments to clients may be breached if downtime is too high.

- **HR Director:** 
HR systems can tolerate short downtimes (under 30 min/month) without major disruption, but onboarding/offboarding tools must remain available during active sessions.
Remote access for HR processes should be restored immediately after outages.
Data integrity must be preserved during downtime.
If downtime affects payroll or benefits processing, employee dissatisfaction rises quickly.

- **Compliance Officer:** 
Compliance-related systems (logging, access control, audit data) must maintain >99.99% uptime — about 4–5 minutes of downtime per month max.
Any gap in logs could invalidate compliance certifications.
Ensure continuity plans keep regulated systems online even during outages.
Missing compliance data due to downtime can trigger penalties or legal exposure.

## Change Management

Downtime during times below shall be awoided. Any maintenance or updates for this departments shall be planned outside of this hours.

### General operations

Spikes occur **Monday mornings** (client kickoffs, proposal submissions) and **Thursday afternoons** (closing deals before week’s end). General operations  require maximum system responsiveness for sales tools and video calls. Ensure no slowdown that might push staff to use unsanctioned tools.

### Finantial

Financial activity spikes at **month-end and quarter-end** for reporting, invoicing, and reconciliations. Weekly, **Fridays** often have heavier payment traffic. Accounting platforms must handle larger data loads without lag.

### In-house operations

Operational load peaks **Tuesday–Thursday** when most project work is underway, and during major product releases. Internal collaboration tools must scale to handle surge in file transfers and communications. System performance shall not drop under load.

### HR Department

HR activity spikes at **start and end of pay periods**, often **mid-week for onboarding sessions**. Applicant tracking and HRIS must remain accessible during group onboarding sessions. Maintain secure access for multiple simultaneous HR logins.

### IT and Support

Compliance review activity increases **week before audits** or regulatory filing deadlines. Must maintain stable connections for large document uploads and remote auditor access. Higher monitoring of traffic during spikes to detect anomalies. Audit readiness can be compromised if systems slow down during preparation.

[^1]: **Recovery Point Objective (RPO).** The RPO is the maximum amount of data, measured in time, that a business can afford to lose after a disruptive event. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO).** The RTO is the maximum amount of time a business can be offline or without its services before the disruption causes significant damage. It answers the question, "How quickly must we get back up and running?" 
[^2]: CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management. CRM tools are software solutions designed to help businesses manage and analyze their interactions with customers and potential customers. Their primary purpose is to streamline processes and improve business relationships, ultimately driving sales and loyalty.
