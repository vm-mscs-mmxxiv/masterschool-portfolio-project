# Business Continuity

Operations of the company must run smoothly without delays and glitches. Even a small period of unavailability can cause revenue loss or sunctions. Operational data should not be lost during interruptions.

Companie's tools and servers must to be continuously available to both office and remote staff. Any disruption longer than a few minutes can cascade into delays across departments, especially in client-facing functions. CEO expects 99.9% uptime minimum. Video calls, screen sharing, and large file uploads/downloads should work seamlessly. Systems tied to sales, proposals, and client communications must have near-continuous availability.

Finantial can tolerate brief slowness, but not downtime.

HR also said that: "Consistency matters more than speed". Onboarding new hires remotely must be seamless regardless of location.

Access to compliance systems, audit trails, and secure document repositories must be uninterrupted. Delays during an audit could lead to penalties.

CEO-Alex

Downtime should not expose data or cause loss of in-progress work.
Even short interruptions during negotiations or presentations can cost deals.
The system should be stable and fast, with no business disruption during or after rollout.
Any new department will need scalable support—let’s avoid hard-coding systems that won’t flex.
Brand reputation is tied to how “buttoned-up” we appear—even physically. A visitor seeing exposed cables or unsecured gear undermines confidence. Give us a network design that keeps infrastructure centralized but extendable to future floors or nearby suites if we expand.

COO-Casey

While uptime is paramount, it must not come at the expense of exposing sensitive operational data or creating backdoors. We need role-based access and proper network segmentation to ensure staff only access what they need.

Scheduled maintenance should happen off-hours with proper alerts. We need strong business continuity planning, including failover and rapid recovery protocols for outages.
Critical systems like access control need uptime even during outages.
Malfunctions in HVAC or access control could disrupt daily operations.
For core operational systems, more than 20 minutes per month of outage causes workflow delays and service backlogs.
Ensure system performance does not drop under load.
Remote and hybrid staff need seamless, reliable access to core systems—file shares, collaboration tools, internal portals—without needing IT support every time. Ideally, log in once, and they're good to go.
