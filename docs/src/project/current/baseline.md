# Baseline Analysis: Current State of Operations

This document provides baseline analysis of the current state of the company's operational, network, and security infrastructure. Compiled through extensive discussions with key executives and stakeholders, this assessment serves as a critical foundation for all future project planning. The findings herein will directly inform the subsequent Statement of Work (SOW), ensuring that all future implementations are built upon a clear and shared understanding of the existing environment.

This comprehensive baseline analysis concludes the initial discovery phase of the project. It provides a detailed "as-is" snapshot of the company's current state. This document is the cornerstone for all subsequent work, as it defines the scope and requirements that will be formalized in the upcoming Statement of Work (SOW).

During the discussion, every time I asked about the current state, I received recommendations and suggestions for how it should be. The responses were quite wordy and looked like a wall of text. Despite this section being originally dedicated to the current state, it became more like a proposal and requirements from highly ranked executives.

Furthermore, executives sometimes contradicted each other. The goal became simply collecting all requests correctly and making sense of them later, taking best practices and common sense as guidance.

## A Personal Note on Project Methodology

Throughout my career, I have observed that many brilliant projects falter not due to a lack of technical expertise but a lack of meticulous planning and documentation. As building contractors often say, "If it looks good on paper, it has a chance to look good after we finish building it."

This detailed baseline analysis, while time-consuming, is not a mere formality. It is the architectural blueprint for a successful project. By investing the time to thoroughly document the current state, we are creating a clear, shared, and auditable foundation. This ensures that every subsequent decision is grounded in reality, minimizing risk and setting the stage for a project that is not only technically sound but also resilient, well-documented, and ultimately successful.
