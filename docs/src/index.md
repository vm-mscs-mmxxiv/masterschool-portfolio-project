# Masterschool Capstone Project


This document outlines a project to assess, design, and propose a sustainable cybersecurity framework for the Company. As the assigned Cybersecurity Engineer, this initiative was informed by a simulated interview process with key company executives, including the CEO, CFO, COO, HR Director, and Compliance Officer. The insights gathered from their perspectives serve as the foundational business and technical requirements for this project.

Given that a baseline security posture assessment was not part of the initial executive inquiry, this project will assume the necessity of foundational security practices, including a comprehensive internal audit, inventory updates, and a review of existing policies and playbooks.

The core of this assignment is a multi-phased approach that will:

- Document and contextualize the executives’ requirements to inform strategic security recommendations.
- Simulate the company's network and key host environments ( as far as technical constrains permit ).
- Implement layered network protection and security controls.
- Run simulated network activity to establish a performance baseline.
- Conduct targeted attacks against the simulated environment to test the efficacy of the implemented defenses.

## Project Notes

I am currently working on a complex, fully virtual project that serves as a simulated exercise rather than a real-world implementation. Due to its simulated nature, the project includes several shortcuts and "hacks" that would not typically be present in a real operational environment.

The current state of the project is not always clearly defined. Even simulated meetings with senior executives have not fully clarified the status or expectations. In situations where no clear data or answer is available, I assume that either no measurements have been implemented or that existing ones are inadequate and would require a complete overhaul.

As part of the managerial responsibilities associated with this role, I may be expected to develop playbooks and update operational procedures across various areas of the company. However, I have refrained from creating full-scale documentation—partly due to time constraints and partly because, in some cases, the lack of clarity around certain configurations makes detailed documentation impractical.

Despite these limitations, I will continue to follow, as closely as possible, the standard operational procedures and responsibilities expected of a Cyber Security Engineer.

## Technical Constrains

Recognizing the technical constraints of executing all simulations on a single machine, the network will be logically segmented into distinct zones.  This approach will allow for focused testing of several key scenarios, providing a comprehensive yet resource-efficient analysis of the company’s security posture.
