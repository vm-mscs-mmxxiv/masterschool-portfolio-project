Intro to NIST CSF & MITRE ATT&CK overviews
üìù Task List & Estimated Effort

#	Task	Est. Effort
1	Gather Requirements: Interview "stakeholders" (via provided prompts) and list functional, performance, and security needs. [Link]	4 h
2	Choose & Justify a Framework: Read brief overviews of NIST CSF vs. MITRE ATT&CK; select one to guide your design and write a 300-word rationale.	3 h
3	Draft Logical Topology: Using your requirements, sketch a diagram showing core switches, routers, VLANs, and segments.	5 h
4	Design IP Scheme: Allocate subnets (e.g., /24, /26) to each VLAN; document address ranges, gateway IPs, and DHCP scopes in a table.	4 h
5	Compile Inventory: List required hardware (model, spec, qty) and software/services (OS, licensing) mapped to requirements.	3 h
6	Risk Assessment: Identify top 3 network risks (e.g., misconfigurations, unauthorized access) and map each to a control from your chosen framework.	4 h
7	Assemble PDF: Combine diagram, tables, rationale, and assessment into a single PDF (‚â§10 pages).	3 h
Total estimated: 26 h over two weeks (~13 h/week).

üí° Example reasoning:
- If you choose NIST CSF ‚Üí You might say: ‚ÄúI chose NIST CSF because this project is about building a secure network from scratch, and CSF provides a structured way to address risks and controls across all stages of the security lifecycle.‚Äù
- If you choose MITRE ATT&CK ‚Üí You might say: ‚ÄúI chose MITRE ATT&CK because the focus of my lab is simulating and detecting real adversary behaviors, and ATT&CK offers a practical mapping of threats to techniques we can replicate.‚Äù

üîç Task Explanations & Industry Rationale

Requirements Gathering

Why it matters: Real network designs begin by understanding business needs. Missing or misconstrued requirements lead to scope creep or insecure designs.

Framework Selection

Why it matters: Frameworks like NIST CSF provide repeatable, audited approaches. Justifying your choice demonstrates critical decision-making.

Topology Diagramming

Why it matters: Visual maps are the lingua franca of network teams; clear diagrams speed up troubleshooting and approvals.

IP Scheme Design

Why it matters: Efficient addressing avoids waste and supports growth. Documenting scopes prevents overlaps in large environments.

Inventory Compilation

Why it matters: Accurate bills of materials inform budgeting and procurement; missing items delay roll-out.

Risk Assessment Mapping

Why it matters: Proactively addressing risks demonstrates security-first thinking and aligns with auditor expectations.

PDF Assembly

Why it matters: A polished deliverable simulates professional proposals and becomes the portfolio artifact recruiters will review.

üîç Task Explanations & Industry Rationale

Hypervisor Setup
Why it matters: In real labs, engineers must stand up virtualization consistently; mastering this ensures reproducible test environments.
VM Deployment
Why it matters: Translating logical designs into VMs builds hands-on skills and parallels cloud-based network functions.
VLAN & Interface Config
Why it matters: VLAN segmentation is fundamental for traffic separation and security zoning in enterprise networks.
IP Assignment & DHCP
Why it matters: Proper addressing and automated IP allocation prevent conflicts and ease device provisioning.
Routing & NAT
Why it matters: Securely routing between segments and enabling external access is core to perimeter defense and network functionality.
Connectivity Testing
Why it matters: Validating configurations and troubleshooting with packet captures demonstrates operational readiness.
Documentation
Why it matters: Clear records of environment and configs support audits, hand-offs, and serve as portfolio artifacts.
