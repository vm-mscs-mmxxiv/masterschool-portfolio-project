# Masterschool Capstone Project


This document outlines a project to assess, design, and propose a sustainable cybersecurity framework for the Company. As the assigned Cybersecurity Engineer, this initiative was informed by a simulated interview process with key company executives, including the CEO, CFO, COO, HR Director, and Compliance Officer. The insights gathered from their perspectives serve as the foundational business and technical requirements for this project.

Given that a baseline security posture assessment was not part of the initial executive inquiry, this project will assume the necessity of foundational security practices, including a comprehensive internal audit, inventory updates, and a review of existing policies and playbooks.

The core of this assignment is a multi-phased approach that will:

- Document and contextualize the executives’ requirements to inform strategic security recommendations.
- Simulate the company's network and key host environments.
- Implement layered network protection and security controls.
- Run simulated network activity to establish a performance baseline.
- Conduct targeted attacks against the simulated environment to test the efficacy of the implemented defenses.

Recognizing the technical constraints of executing all simulations on a single machine, the network will be logically segmented into distinct zones. This approach will allow for focused testing of several key scenarios, providing a comprehensive yet resource-efficient analysis of the company’s security posture. The conclusions from this analysis, compiled in the 'Initial State' section, will inform all subsequent recommendations and plans.
