# Masterschool Capstone Project

## Objective

I have to act as if I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer tasked to create, monitor, run midsize company security.
As part of the assignment there was a simulated chat with hihgly ranked executives of the company. General conclusions of the companie's specifications are as following.

### Company objectives and structure

The company is middle size consulting company. Specializing in providing business consulting, data-driven strategy, and digital transformation support to mid-size and enterprise clients. Company have publicly available as well as highly secure data. Data privacy vary depending on the client's needs.

Companie's Operations are subject to heavy regulations. GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS.     
The Company is subject to industry audit and certifications.

### Current Department Sizes (‚âà100 employees total)

- Client Services / Consulting ‚Äì ~35 people (core delivery team)
- Sales & Marketing ‚Äì ~15 people
- Finance & Accounting ‚Äì ~8 people
- Human Resources ‚Äì ~6 people
- IT & Systems Support ‚Äì ~10 people
- Operations / Admin ‚Äì ~12 people
- Compliance & Risk ‚Äì ~5 people
- Leadership / Executive ‚Äì ~4 people

### Projected Growth (2‚Äì3 Years)

- Client Services / Consulting: +30‚Äì40% growth (driven by new contracts and expansion into new regions). Expect to reach ~45‚Äì50 staff.
- Sales & Marketing: +25‚Äì30% growth to expand market share‚Äîlikely 18‚Äì20 staff.
- Finance & Accounting: Minimal growth (~10‚Äì15%) as automation offsets headcount increases‚Äî9‚Äì10 staff.
- Human Resources: +30‚Äì40% to handle hiring surge‚Äîlikely 8‚Äì9 staff.
- IT & Systems Support: +50% growth due to network expansion, multi-site support‚Äîup to 15 staff.
- Operations / Admin: +20% to maintain service levels‚Äî~14‚Äì15 staff.
- Compliance & Risk: +40‚Äì50% due to more regulated clients‚Äîup to 7‚Äì8 staff.
- Leadership / Executive: Small increase as structure flattens‚Äîlikely 5‚Äì6 executives.

### Plans to grow and expand

- Geographic expansion (possible satellite offices)
- More remote hires, more BYOD. Requiring stronger IT and HR presence
- Diversification into data analytics and digital transformation services
- Increasing compliance demands from larger and more regulated clients
- Increase usage of modern solutinos such as AI in day-to-day activities
- Considering creating new teams in Data Analytics and Product Development
- There is a possibility of HQ relocation. Legal complience, need in more space, security can drive stakeholders to this decision.

## The Office

The Office is a mix of open workspaces, private offices, meeting rooms, and a server/storage room on the second floor. Staff are split between on-site and remote, with around 40 people regularly in the office. The server room is badge-access only, and our main entrance requires electronic access. Visitor sign-in is manual for now but managed at reception. Currently, about 60% on-site, 40% remote. This  expect to shift closer to 50/50 as more distributed talent hired.

The building has been audited and certified within the last 12 months to accommodate highly data-sensitive operations. This includes compliance with relevant building security standards, controlled access, and infrastructure resilience requirements. Certificates are on file and available for inspection.

### The Office's Floor plan

Ground floor

- Reception      
- Sales & Marketing (Partition)
- Meeting Room
- Client Services 
- Pantry / Canteen
- General Workspace


Second floor

- Server Room (Secure)
- HR Dept (Partition)
- Finance Dept (Partition)
- Meeting Room
- Compliance & Risk (Partition)
- IT Support

### The Office's Inventory and power supply

UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supplies) are installed for critical systems‚Äîincluding the server room, networking equipment, and key workstations in **Finance, HR, and Compliance**. They provide short-term power during outages to allow for safe shutdown or switchover.


### Office Networking

Don't assume we have wiring everywhere‚Äîwe may need to retrofit. Employees need uninterrupted access to systems regardless of floor or location.

On-site staff need stable LAN and Wi-Fi, while remote teams rely on cloud tools, VPNs, and video calls

## Data

## Cybersecurity

Physical access to employee files (both digital and printed) is tightly controlled. Sensitive areas are locked, and file cabinets are restricted.

Ensure that the cabling layout and switch placements don‚Äôt expose us to tampering (e.g., unsecured patch panels or wall jacks in public areas).


The server room is compliant, but other closets or impromptu setups wouldn‚Äôt be.

## Suggestions

- Need proper physical setup.
- cabling inspection and audit to prevent MITM.
- is is not clear if windows are dimmed so that it is impossible to spy on the company with optical equipement
- There is a whole floor between our flors that mean that cables can be tampered there to install taps.

üìù Task List & Estimated Effort

#	Task	Est. Effort
1	Gather Requirements: Interview "stakeholders" (via provided prompts) and list functional, performance, and security needs. [Link]	4 h
2	Choose & Justify a Framework: Read brief overviews of NIST CSF vs. MITRE ATT&CK; select one to guide your design and write a 300-word rationale.	3 h
3	Draft Logical Topology: Using your requirements, sketch a diagram showing core switches, routers, VLANs, and segments.	5 h
4	Design IP Scheme: Allocate subnets (e.g., /24, /26) to each VLAN; document address ranges, gateway IPs, and DHCP scopes in a table.	4 h
5	Compile Inventory: List required hardware (model, spec, qty) and software/services (OS, licensing) mapped to requirements.	3 h
6	Risk Assessment: Identify top 3 network risks (e.g., misconfigurations, unauthorized access) and map each to a control from your chosen framework.	4 h
