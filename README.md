# Capstone Project: Masterschool Portfolio Project

## Overview

This project serves as a capstone for a Masterschool Cybersecurity Programm. It is a hybrid effort, encompassing both managerial and technical components to address the challenge of designing and implementing a secure and resilient IT infrastructure for a medium-sized enterprise. This includes establishing secure operations, configuring robust networking, and hardening end hosts. This repository represents a comprehensive and version-controlled record of the entire project lifecycle, from initial documentation to technical implementation.

### Motivation

The decision to host this project on GitHub was made for several strategic reasons:

- **Cloud Persistence:** It provides a reliable cloud-based home for all project assets, ensuring the work is securely saved.
- **Version Control:** The use of a robust Version Control System (VCS) allows for meticulous tracking of all changes, both in documentation and code, facilitating a clear development history.
- **Centralized Repository:** By consolidating all documentation and code into a single, unified repository, this approach ensures a tidy and well-organized project structure, which is crucial for a project of this dual nature.
- **Project Longevity:** This repository will remain live, allowing for continuous iteration and improvement beyond the project's submission date.

### Project Structure

This repository is organized to clearly separate the projectâ€™s two core components:

- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation, reports, and necessary writing. The content is formatted in Markdown and compiled into a project website using the [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html)  utility.
- `ansible/`: Houses all the technical code required for the project's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation, leveraging the [Ansible](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/stable/)  automation tool.
